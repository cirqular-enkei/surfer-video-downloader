# Render Deployment Guide

## Current Issue: "Frontend not built" Error

The issue is that Render is not finding the frontend build files. Here's how to fix it:

### 1. Check Render Build Settings

In your Render dashboard, verify these settings:

**Build Command:**
```bash
npm run build
```

**Start Command:**
```bash
npm start
```

**Environment Variables:**
- `NODE_ENV`: `production`

### 2. Verify Build Process

The build process should:
1. Install root dependencies: `npm install`
2. Install frontend dependencies: `cd frontend && npm install`
3. Build frontend: `npm run build` (creates `frontend/dist/`)
4. Install backend dependencies: `cd ../backend && npm install`

### 3. Check Build Logs

In Render dashboard, check the build logs for:
- ✅ "Found frontend build at: [path]"
- ✅ "Found index.html at: [path]"
- ❌ "Frontend build not found in any expected location"

### 4. Expected File Structure After Build

```
/
├── frontend/
│   ├── dist/           ← Frontend build files
│   │   ├── index.html
│   │   ├── assets/
│   │   └── ...
├── backend/
│   └── src/
│       └── app.js
└── package.json
```

### 5. Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Check Build Logs**: Look for any errors during the build process
2. **Verify Frontend Build**: Ensure `frontend/dist/index.html` exists
3. **Check Environment**: Ensure `NODE_ENV=production` is set
4. **Redeploy**: Trigger a new deployment after fixing settings

### 6. Manual Verification

You can test the build locally:
```bash
npm run build
ls -la frontend/dist/
```

This should show the built frontend files.

### 7. Render-Specific Notes

- Render runs the build command in the root directory
- The backend serves static files from the frontend build
- All-in-one deployment (frontend + backend on same service)
- Port is automatically assigned by Render

### 8. Alternative: Separate Frontend/Backend

If the all-in-one approach doesn't work, consider:
1. **Frontend**: Deploy to Vercel/Netlify
2. **Backend**: Deploy to Render
3. **CORS**: Configure CORS for cross-origin requests

## Current Status

✅ Backend API working (health check passes)
✅ Frontend build process configured
❌ Frontend files not being served by backend

The fix should be deployed automatically after the git push.
